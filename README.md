 

Hi! Iâ€™m Jamie.
ðŸ‘‹  ðŸ‘‹  ðŸ‘‹  

I am a proactive Junior Front-End Developer with almost 8 months experience with React, JavaScript ES6, HTML, CSS / Tailwind / Sass, Typescript, Git using the Azure Repo, and CI/CI deployment to Azure pipelines.

Along with having a Computer Science degree (M.A. in Web Development, U.O.C. Barcelona, June 2022), my strongest skills are passion for technology, persistence with problem solving and support for my team in achieving our objectives.
