 

Hi! I’m Jamie.
👋  👋  👋   

I am looking for a JUNIOR FRONT-END position where my team can win champions and move mountains on a daily basis. My biggest skills are persistence, problem solving and passion.

I am completing a master’s in Web Development (spring 2022) at the Open University of Catalonia. This has given me a rock-solid foundation in all aspects of Front-End Development, from unit test to Agile development to UI/UX concepts like “don’t make me think” to refactoring code. I have a deep level of experience with Angular, along with Typescript.

Along with that, I have 3 years of experience curating online learning materials for English-language learning using the WordPress control panel.
