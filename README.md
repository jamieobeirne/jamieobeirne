 

Hi! I’m Jamie.
👋  👋  👋   

I am currently working as a Junior Front End Developer building and launching a voice-recognition educational tool, “Simon Says”, made with “technical curiosity” and Angular. 

Along with that, I am completing my training as a Front-End developer (M.A. in Web Development, June 2022, U.O.C.) and I’m achieving my own personal “digital transformation”.  This has given me a rock-solid foundation in all aspects of Front-End Development, from unit testing to Agile development to UI/UX concepts like “don’t make me think” to refactoring code. I have experience with configuring AWS servers.

My greatest skills are troubleshooting, persistence and a passion for professional development. I am looking for a team where we can achieve big goals! 

For an example of my "pixel perfect" development skills relating to ECMAScript, CSS and HTML, please view my Wikipedia clone:
