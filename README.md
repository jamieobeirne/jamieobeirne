Hi, I’m Jamie O'Beirne.

I’m a looking for a team where we can win champions and move mountains on a daily basis. 

I have 3+ years’ experience as a front end developer and 1+ year of Angular development with single page apps.

Programming is modern carpentry and celebration should start Monday morning by achieving our goals together. My biggest skills are persistence, problem solving and passion.
