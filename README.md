Hi, I’m Jamie O'Beirne.

I’m a looking for a team where we can win champions and move mountains on a daily basis. 

I have 3+ years’ experience as a front end developer and 1+ year of Angular development with single page apps.

Programming is modern carpentry. Rather than waiting until the weekend, celebrating should happen each weekday by achieving our work goals together. My biggest skills are persistence, problem solving and passion.
